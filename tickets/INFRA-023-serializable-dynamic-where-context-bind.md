## Problem

A narrowing's `where` is the tenant/permission **scope** — "from what you can see, this is true" (`ModelDefaultNarrowing.where`). Today the only way to express a *tenant-specific* scope is a **runtime closure**:

```ts
scopeNarrowing((c) => ({ root: { where: { field: 'brandUuid', operator: 'equals', value: getBrand(c).uuid } } }))
```

The concrete `brandUuid` is baked in by the closure reading it off the request context; `buildWhereClause` folds the stacked chain into the query. That closure is **code, not data**, and that's the blocker:

- **It can't be persisted.** A narrowing whose scope is a closure can't be stored on a row, so a *brandless* config object — e.g. an email template default that every brand inherits — cannot carry its own tenant-scoped narrowing. The scope has to be re-supplied by a hand-written closure at every call site.
- **INFRA-016 doesn't cover it.** Serialization-by-ref keeps `where` as-is, but only as a **literal** Condition (`{ value: 'brand-abc' }`). Serializing the closure's output bakes one tenant's id in (defeats brandless); serializing without it loses the scope. There's no third option today.
- **`path` doesn't help.** `ValueSource = { value } | { path }`, and `path` resolves against the **evaluated subject** (the row being filtered) — it is row-relative. The tenant scope is an **external** parameter ("the current brand"), not a field of the row, so `path` can't express it.

Net: every dynamically-scoped narrowing is forced to be a code closure, so it can't ride serialized config — per-slug email narrowings, admin-saved lenses (INFRA-018).

## Possible solution — a context-bind value type

Add a third `ValueSource` alongside `{ value }` (literal) and `{ path }` (row-relative): a **context-bind** token resolved at execution against a supplied bindings map.

```ts
// proposed
type ValueSource<T> =
  | { value: T;     path?: never; bind?: never }
  | { path: string; value?: never; bind?: never }
  | { bind: string; value?: never; path?: never };  // resolved from execution bindings
```

`{ bind }` is a third arm on the **shared** `ValueSource<T>` that every rule kind already uses, so it is valid **anywhere a literal can go** — equality, comparison, `in`/`notIn`, `contains`, `between`, aggregate — for free, no per-rule special-casing. (Date rules carry their own value shape; extend it identically.) A narrowing's `where` then reads `{ field: 'brandUuid', operator: 'equals', bind: 'brandUuid' }` — fully serializable, **brandless**, storable on the default config row.

**`where` (and its binds) are server-only — that's the protection.** Two artifacts, per INFRA-017: `exposedSurface` is the client-facing surface and is **`where`-stripped**, so neither a `where` nor a `{ bind }` token ever reaches the browser. `projectByPath` keeps `where` (`ProjectedVisit.whereClauses`) and is server-side only. Binds therefore resolve **server-side**: into (a) the source-eligibility queries that produce `sourceValues` — the option lists the client *does* receive, as resolved values, never the binds — and (b) the execution `where` via `applyLens`/`toPrisma`/`toSql`. You protect the scope by **never sending it**, not by trying to make a sent object immutable; the rule the client returns is independently re-validated (`checkRuleAgainstLens`) and the server's `where` is folded in regardless of what the client submits. `bindings` fold into the **server** projection exactly as 2.10 folds `sourceValues` — without bindings the projection keeps `{ bind }` tokens (the portable form), with bindings it resolves them; one resolver, and `toPrisma`/`toSql` emit a resolved bind as a query **parameter**. (If you want the user to *see* their scope as UX — "scoped to your brand" — that's a separate, explicitly read-only informational field, never the executable `where`.)

**Required bindings are introspectable + validated.** `requiredBindings(lensOrRule): Set<string>` — a `collectBinds` walk over the narrowing chain's `where`/`sources` and the rule — returns the set of bind **names** needed, so the builder / `exposedSurface` can declare "this surface needs `{ brandUuid }`." The two shapes are different: introspection is a `Set<string>` (names); the execution input is a `Record<string, RuleValue>` (name → value), since each `{ bind }` resolves to a value. At execution, validate `keys(bindings) ⊇ requiredBindings(lens)` and **throw on any missing required bind**: a forgotten tenant scope is a caller bug, and silently returning no rows would hide it (and risk an unscoped path slipping through).

The only runtime input is then the bindings map, supplied where context is known: `{ brandUuid: getBrand(c).uuid }` on an API request; `{ brandUuid: recipient.brandUuid }` at email send. The `scopeNarrowing((c) => …)` closure collapses into "a static serialized narrowing + a one-line bindings resolver."

**All of this lives in json-rules core** — the `{ bind }` value type, the resolver, `requiredBindings`, and bindings-folding in projection. Template and Zealot just pass a `bindings` map; no app-layer reimplementation.

### Properties

- **Leak-safe** — `exposedSurface` still strips `where` for the untrusted client; bind tokens never reach the browser.
- **Checkable** — `checkRuleAgainstLens` / `validateNarrowing` validate the token structurally (field exists, operator valid) without a value.
- **Closed vocabulary** — bind names must be a **declared set** (`brandUuid`, `recipientUuid`, `locale`, `senderId`, …), validated at deserialize, so a stored `where` can never reference unbound context.
- **Generalizes beyond email** — every `scopeNarrowing` closure becomes declarative data; admin-saved lenses (INFRA-018) carry their own scope.

## Progressive binding (partial application)

Narrowings compose (`parent` chain), so binding is **monotonic partial application**, not all-or-nothing:

- Any layer may introduce `{ bind }` tokens in its `where`/`sources`.
- `resolveLensBindings(lensOrNarrowing, bindings)` is a chain→chain transform: it resolves the tokens the map covers and **leaves the rest as tokens**; `lensRequiredBindings` shrinks accordingly. (`resolveBindings`/`requiredBindings` are the Condition-level primitives it builds on.)
- Stages bind what they know: `{ brandUuid }` at request/author time, `{ recipientUuid }` at send. Execution (`check`/`toPrisma`) requires `requiredBindings` to be **empty** — else throw.
- Resolving only ever **narrows** (a bound literal adds a concrete filter), never widens — consistent with the chain's existing narrow-only invariant (`validateNarrowing`).

(Partial resolution was also the engine behind the old `seal` idea — resolve a fixed tenant's binds, preserve a subtenant's as tokens. `seal` is now dropped: the server is the sole executor and the floor is structural, so there's no handoff to seal. See INFRA-016.)

**Unique names + `parent:` (decided) — downward-only without per-layer maps.** Bind names are **unique across a composed chain**: a layer may not re-declare a name an ancestor already declares. `validateNarrowing` reads the ancestors' occupied names (`lensRequiredBindings(narrowing.parent)`) and **hard-errors** on a collision, naming it so the author picks better — *not* a warning. Because every name is unique, a single bindings map keyed by name is unambiguous, and downward-only falls out for free: a child can't *re-bind* a parent's scope because it can't even declare the parent's name. To *intentionally* reuse an inherited binding, the child references it read-only as **`parent:name`** — it draws the same value as the ancestor's `name`, is excluded from the collision check, and a `parent:` ref no ancestor declares is rejected. (This supersedes the earlier "reuse is safe — don't forbid it" sketch, which assumed per-layer maps; the unique-name rule is cleaner, is enforceable at author time, and the collision message is itself the "see what the parent occupies" affordance.)

**Sources hydrate *after* bindings — the order matters.** A source's eligibility `where` (the per-field `sources` Condition) carries bind tokens too — "this brand's missions" = `where brandUuid = { bind: 'brandUuid' }`. So the pipeline is **resolve this layer's bindings → then hydrate sources** (run the now-concrete DISTINCT query) → tenant-specific `sourceValues` → fold into the surface. You can't hydrate before binding: you don't yet know *which* tenant's rows to query. Per layer: resolve binds, then hydrate that layer's sources.

## Legibility — reading a complex narrowing's binds

You should never have to eyeball raw `where`s across a deep chain to know what a lens needs. Because names are unique across the chain, **the name is the key** — no assigned layer ids are needed (this is why intrinsic lens/narrowing identity, earlier proposed here, dropped out):

- **`lensRequiredBindings(lensOrNarrowing)` → `Set<string>`** — every bind name the lens needs supplied; `parent:` refs collapse to their base name. Pass `narrowing.parent` to see exactly the names a child must not collide with. You *ask the lens*; you don't read its `where`s.
- **`parent:name`** is the only qualifier needed — it marks an inherited, read-only reference. Since the bare name is already unique chain-wide, there's nothing further to disambiguate.

## Decided 2026-06-29

- **Bind preprocesses into the lens — nothing new downstream.** `resolveLensBindings` → concrete lens → existing `applyLens`/`toPrisma`/`toSql`/`sources`/projection unchanged. Drops the `bindings`-plumbing, intrinsic-identity, and projection-folding work this ticket originally pulled in.
- **Unique names + collision = hard error; `parent:name` for intentional read-only reuse.** (See above; supersedes the per-layer-maps sketch.)
- **`seal` dropped** — the server is the sole executor and each party authors only its own layer, so the parent floor is structural (chain compose + narrow-only + server-side bind resolution); there's no off-server handoff to seal. INFRA-016 reduced to ref-id serialization (liveness for persisted base lenses), which the bindings path doesn't even need (reattach a code-built parent).

## Still open

- Token vocabulary + where it's declared (a per-app bindings registry?) — needed once lenses persist, not for the email path.
- **Semver**: additive under the decided design → 2.11 vs cut 3.0.0 anyway. See FEAT-004.
- Missing-vs-deliberately-empty binding nuance (caller bug → throw; empty → fail closed, never widen).

## Related Tickets

- **Sibling to** INFRA-016 (serialize structure-by-ref) — this makes the *dynamic where* serializable (bind tokens); together they make a narrowing fully persistable. (INFRA-016 not required for the email path.)
- **Feeds** INFRA-017 (builder surface), INFRA-018 (lens builder — saved lenses carry scope).
- **Motivating consumer:** Zealot per-slug email narrowings (`userevidence/Zealot-Monorepo` ZLT-3169) — the default template can only carry its own narrowing as config once the brand scope is a bind token, not a closure.
